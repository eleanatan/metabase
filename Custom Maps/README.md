# Creating Custom Maps on Metabase for Maps Visualisation

Imported json files containing coordinate information for Kenya counties here

https://github.com/Mondieki/kenya-counties-subcounties/tree/master/geojson

Made modifications to fit structure of geojson file
1) Needs to have Feature property inside
2) Use geojson.io to validate if the file is working

Copy raw URL of final combined geojson file into the Metabase admin settings interface for Custom Maps
